1. What tasks do I want my chatbot to do?
- Search a database of tweets for a subject
- Conduct a sentiment analysis on the tweets
- generate a visualization

2. User will express things in various ways. Bot should be able to understand different utterances/variances

3. Write logic to keep user tied to the flow that *you* hav chosen for the bot, after it has recognized the user's intent.

- Decision trees 
- A graph or model of decisiosn and their possible consequences, including 
    - chance event outcomes
    - resource costs
    - utility

Bot Intent: refers to the user's intention 

Entities: metadata about the Intent:
- ex: booking a ticket is the intent; the movie in question could be the entity, or the flight, the concert, etc.

Utterances: forms of the same question
- Optimum 10 utterances per intent; min. 5

Training the bot: build a model that will categorize utterances based on intents, entities, and predefined utterances. 

COnfidence score: What intent does an utterance belong to? >> how confident is the model in categorizing correctly?

List of Intents, entities:
1. Greeting Intent
2. Selecting Company Intent

Rasa concepts
Action class: 
    name method: returns the name of the Action
    - referred to in the domain file as "custom method name"
    run method takes params:
    - dispatcher: sends messages. dispatcher.utter_message()
    - tracker: state tracker..
        - tracker.get_slot(slot_name) (see below)
        - tracker.latest_message.text -- most recent user message
    - domain: bot's domain.
    Run method returns a list of Events instances.

Slots: 
- storage space for user-given info or prefetched info.
- text, boolean, categorical, float, list, featurized

Templates: for utterances

 “The Domain defines the universe in which your
bot operates. It specifies the intents, entities, slots, 
and actions your bot should know
about. Optionally, it can also include templates for the
things your bot can say.”
